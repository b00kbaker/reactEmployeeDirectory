  ## Description 
  
  *The what, why, and how:* 
   This directory runs as a React App using Components to render employee data from an external API (https://randomuser.me/api/). A search bar allows the user to type inquiries or can filter the people by ascending or descending order based on First Name, Last Name, Phone Number, Email, or DOB.

  
  ## Instructions
   The app can be accessed online (https://b00kbaker.github.io/reactEmployeeDirectory/) and easily searched via text input or filtering via button.
